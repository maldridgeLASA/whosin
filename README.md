This project is no longer under active development!
Those looking for a jumping off point may start here, but this code is no
longer actively maintained.  When I get bored, an occasional commit may be
made, but this code should not be considered production quality as it stands
now!

This program aims to provide an authorization and access control system using
RFID cards.  Cards are read using proximity readers, and sent serially to the
server where they are checked against a database and then a response is sent
to the microprocessor which controls the door locks.


This program should run well wherever the PySerial and jsondb libraries can be
installed:
